### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Lina M Herrera

Business Administrator with more than 12 years of experience in different sectors and positions that require a good **English** level. I found my passion in technology, thatâ€™s why I am currently studying **software development** and test automation. My goal is to be able to join a company where I can give my best and continue learning from this wonderful world. I have skills such as teamwork, detail and achievement orientation, resourcefulness, method, curiosity, problem solving, among others, that I apply in everything I do.

This intro is under construction, Thanks for your understanding and support.
